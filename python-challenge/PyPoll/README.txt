README
This program will analyze elections results in a dataset with 
column 0 as individual Voter ID, column 1 as County, and column 2
as Candidate. It outputs total votes cast, a list of all candidates 
receiving at least 1 vote, count and percentage of votes for each
candidate, and the winner of the election.

The directory must have a csv dataset named 'election_data' with the
above criteria, as well as a sub-directory titled 'Output'. When running
the program, the output will be printed to the terminal and generated
in a txt file in the 'Output' directory.
