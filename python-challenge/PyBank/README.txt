This program will analyze financial records in a dataset with 
column 0 as individual Fiscal Month, and column 1 as Revenue(Profit/Losses). 
It outputs a count of total fiscal months, total revenue, average monthly change,
most profitable fiscal month with total, and biggest fiscal month loss with total.  

The directory must have a csv dataset named 'budget_data' with the
above criteria, as well as a sub-directory titled 'Output'. When running
the program, the output will be printed to the terminal and generated
in a txt file in the 'Output' directory.
